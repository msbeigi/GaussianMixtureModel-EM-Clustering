# Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with Expectation-Maximization (EM)

This repository contains Python code for Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.

## Introduction

GMM is a probabilistic model that represents a mixture of Gaussian distributions. The EM algorithm is employed to estimate the parameters of the Gaussian components. This code provides an implementation for clustering data using GMM with EM.
The Expectation (E) step is a crucial part of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, and it plays a central role in estimating the parameters of models, particularly in the context of probabilistic models like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs).
The EM algorithm is used when dealing with problems where some of the data is unobserved or missing. It is an iterative optimization algorithm that aims to find the maximum likelihood (ML) or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of parameters in statistical models. GMM is a probabilistic model that assumes that the data is generated by a mixture of several Gaussian distributions. Each Gaussian component represents a cluster in the data.
